Just think: A little low-key scrolling today sows the seeds for endless vernal beauty in the sunny days ahead. Courtesy of brand Kat Von D Pastel Goth Eyeshadow Palette Before you quickly thumb down to the next slide, hear us out on this one. The pastel shades may seem intimidating—and actually like pastel is a misnomer considering they are so vibrant—but they are surprisingly easy to use. Allure editors recently tried them out on a Facebook Live and realized Clementine (a peach) and Meow (a lilac) are actually amazing neutrals; Doom (a sky blue) was flattering on all skin tones. Nars Narsissist Unfiltered II Cheek Palette Branch out from Nars Blush in Orgasm with six new Nars blushes. Use the pinks for a natural, just-got-back-from-SoulCycle flush (sans um, all that sweat), and the peach shades to brighten sallow cheeks. Whether you want a dramatic glow or a no-makeup makeup vibe, the mix of matte and shimmery finishes lends the ideal flush for every occasion. Courtesy of brand Maybelline The 24K Nudes Palette We didn't name this palette one of best new drugstore beauty launches of 2017 for nothing. The Maybelline The 24K Nudes Palette takes the idea of a neutral palette to the next level. Each of the 12 shades are flecked with metallic gold pigments, so you can have a hint of shimmer, whether you're on team bold smoky eyes or squad sheer wash of color. Courtesy of brand Sephora Collection Sephora PRO Dimensional Highlighting Palette We'd be lying if we said we weren't completely sold on this palette based on its holographic cover alone. One glance is almost like meditating, only without the mindfulness. Inside the palette, you'll find chromatic highlighters in three cool-toned shades, plus two versatile face glosses. Courtesy of brand YSL The Street and I Couture Palette Collection Between the rose gold , fuchsia , and orangey peach eye shadows, this palette will let you experiment with the latest on-trend shades. Plus, the cover is total flat lay bait. It deserves all the likes. Courtesy of brand L'Oréal Infallible Paints Blush Palette These blushes are about as close as you're going to get to cheek stains in powdered form. The rosy, hot pink, and coral hues can be swiped alone or swirled together, plus, amazingly, they don't fade away throughout the day. Courtesy of brand Givenchy Nudes Nacres Shimmering Nudes Eye Palette If you're looking for a still-cool alternative to all the holographic rainbow shadows in your life, please meet this sophisticated little set. Sure, you could create a low-key look with the matte brown shades in this palette. For me, it's all about the three glittery shades. They're packed with pearlescent particles that give lids an almost 3D finish that still stays elegant. Courtesy of brand Anastasia Beverly Hills Lip Palette Combine two or three of the 18 creamy lip colors to create your own custom hue. Just scrape some onto the included mixing plate to whip up the just-bitten popsicle, blackberry, or fiery coral of your wildest color dreams. Courtesy of brand CoverGirl TruNaked Jewels Eyeshadow Palette If you haven't already watched James Charles and Zendaya challenge each other to create complete looks with CoverGirl's newest palette in under 10 minutes, we strongly suggest doing so ASAP. Just try to resist trying their blue-and-purple shadow look at home. Courtesy of brand Chanel Coco Code Blush Harmony Palette Spoiler alert: This is the quad that was behind that mysterious Rubik's cube the brand teased last fall. Tap on each shade individually to highlight, contour, and enliven your cheekbones. Stippling on all four yields a pretty—and irresistible—peach. Courtesy of brand NYX Lid Lingerie Shadow Palette NYX took their popular Lip Lingerie and turned them into matte eye shadows with a velvety texture—just like the liquid lipsticks. Because they're so creamy, they're super blendable, so you can create seamless definition and color on your lids—pretty much with your fingertips. Courtesy of brand Fiona Stiles Multidimensional Color Palette A cheek palette curated by a celebrity makeup artist? Yes, please. Fiona Stiles, who's worked with Lily Collins, Gabrielle Union, and Bryce Dallas Howard, put together a set of universally flattering shades of bronzer, highlighter, and blush that she now keeps in her kit for awards shows. Most recently, she used it for the SAG Awards . Courtesy of brand Urban Decay Afterdark Palette If you're a fan of the Kat Von D Alchemist Holographic Palette, then you'll love the duochrome shadows in this 10-shade eye shadow palette . The jewel tones transform into different colors depending on the way light hits them; they also can be brushed on over lipstick for a metallic finish. Courtesy of brand Stila Matte 'N Metal Eye Shadow Palette Consider this the Naked Palette version of the Kat Von D MetalMatte Eyeshadow Palette . Why? The top half is made up of neutral matte shades, while the bottom is all about shimmer. Courtesy of brand Smashbox Cover Shot Eye Palette in Ablaze Smashbox just launched seven new credit card-sized palettes, but this warmed-toned selection is one of our favorites because of the burgundies and coppers. And Shay Mitchell , who is the face of the collection, loves this one, too. She's been known to use it on Snapchat .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:06:22.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
