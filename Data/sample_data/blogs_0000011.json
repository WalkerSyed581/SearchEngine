Goals have been coming freely for Dembele in Scotland (Photo: Getty) \nHowever, despite being pictured on a flight to London, Dembele was only in town for a hospital visit - but Rodgers was taking no chances. \n\"We had to make sure the physio didn't lose sight of him down there,\" Rodgers told. \n\"Ironically the hospital he was in was in Chelsea, believe it or not. So I said to Tim, be like Franco Baresi and just stay tight to him. \n\"But he was happy to come back. He is loving it here. He got some fluid out of his knee, he has had a good reaction to it, so we will see how he is for the weekend,\" Rodgers added.
